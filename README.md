# Tolly

A portable Tauri 2 desktop app for talking with someone who sounds like a person. You speak, Groq Whisper transcribes, Groq replies in a casual voice and may wander onto an ordinary topic, and Cartesia Sonic speaks the reply. Quieter phrasing notes stay on screen. A speaking-skill score for the current conversation sits in the top corner.

API keys are yours. Nothing is read from a `.env` file.

## Layout

- React (TypeScript, Tailwind) shows the conversation and grammar card in the main view, with a microphone dock and a Settings modal.
- Rust owns the Groq and Cartesia HTTP calls. Cartesia audio still streams. The chat model returns one JSON object at a time, because a streamed JSON reply was coming back empty on the next turn.
- A `data` folder next to the executable holds everything Tolly saves. API keys are in an encrypted snapshot there. Preferences and the daily token ledger are in `settings.json`. Nothing is written to the system keychain or to AppData.

The model is instructed to return only:

```json
{
  "spoken_reply": "Short conversational response",
  "visual_feedback": ["Correction 1", "Correction 2"],
  "skill_rating": 75
}
```

The main view is the conversation: a status line, your last line and Tolly's reply in two bubbles, and a Grammar Correction card that shows the phrase you used in red with the clearer version in green, plus a tip when a note is not a direct swap. The window icon still comes from `logo.png`. The bottom dock has a microphone level bar, an End button, the big microphone button, and Replay for Tolly's last line. Tap the microphone once and Tolly listens on its own, hold it while you speak to control each sentence, and talk over Tolly to cut in. The level bar lights up blue for sound and purple when the sound has the shape of a voice. Tolly learns the quiet level of the room and only takes a turn when the sound repeats at a speaking pitch and carries energy above 300 Hz, so a fan, a hum, or typing does not count. `spoken_reply` is what Cartesia says.

Settings is split into tabs. Keys holds the API keys and the model lists. Voice picks the Cartesia voice, speaking speed, and volume, with a preview. Microphone chooses the microphone and speaker, sets sensitivity to Low, Normal, or High, and has a live test that counts the sentences Tolly would have heard. Look sets font size (down to 11) and layout with a live preview. About has the daily token budget, the GitHub updater, and key removal. A `429` from Groq or Cartesia is shown as a rate-limit notice. Calls stop once today's token budget is spent.

## Portable builds

Bundled targets are `.app`, `.dmg`, and `.AppImage` only. MSI and NSIS are not configured.

```bash
npm install
npm run icons
npm run desktop
```

`npm run icons` builds the window and taskbar icons from `logo.png`.

Windows portable executable (a single `.exe`, no setup wizard):

```bash
npm run build:portable
```

The binary is `src-tauri/target/release/ai-speaking-pal.exe`. Copy that file anywhere and run it. Windows 11 already includes WebView2. A Windows 10 machine needs the WebView2 runtime installed separately because this build does not embed a setup wizard.

macOS `.app` and `.dmg`:

```bash
npm run build:macos
```

Linux `.AppImage`:

```bash
npm run build:linux
```

Rust 1.77 or newer and Node 20 or newer are required. Tolly keeps its `data` folder beside the executable, so you can move that folder with the app.

## GitHub release

This copy is 1.1.1. Push `main` to [YHOneBox/Tolly-AI_Speaking_Pal](https://github.com/YHOneBox/Tolly-AI_Speaking_Pal), then push a version tag. The tag must match `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and the same version in `package.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. The in-app updater only accepts files from that repository. When the update finishes, the app file is renamed to `Tolly-v` plus the new version, and the window title shows that version.

```bash
git push origin main
git tag v1.1.1
git push origin v1.1.1
```

The workflow publishes:

- `Tolly-v1.1.1-windows-x64.exe`
- `Tolly-v1.1.1-macos.dmg` and a zipped `.app`
- `Tolly-v1.1.1-linux-x64.AppImage`

It does not build an MSI or an NSIS setup.

## Settings

Open Settings and paste a Groq key and a Cartesia key. The Groq key loads the chat and Whisper models that key can use. The Cartesia key loads voices from `GET /voices`. Spoken audio uses Cartesia `sonic-3.5` over `POST /tts/sse`.
